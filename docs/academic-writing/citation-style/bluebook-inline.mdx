## How do I cite in  Bluebook Inline?

Let us produce some example in-text-citations:

:::note Citations


This sentence refers to the first item from the table. Jane Doe, <i>Title #1</i>, 3 <span style={{"font-variant":"small-caps"}}>Imaginary Journal</span> 1â€“999 (2008) This, in turn, refers to the second <span style={{"font-variant":"small-caps"}}>Title #2</span>, https://example.com/ (last visited May 1, 2021)
and then to the third.  Jane Doe et al., <i>Title #3</i>, <span style={{"font-variant":"small-caps"}}>ABC</span> 
This paragraph demonstrates the clustering of citations by citing the first and third item. Doe; Doe et al.

## How do I create a bibliography in Bluebook Inline?

This bibliography contains all items from the sample table. Please note that these examples in the table consist only of articles. Other source types may require different handling, such as web pages that expect an access date, or movies, music tracks etc.

While we would like to show a few such concrete examples in the future - this series of articles is in fact in progress - we would like to point out that CiteDrive already features them.
