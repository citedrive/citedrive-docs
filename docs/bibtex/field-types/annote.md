# Annote
BibTeX Field type: ``annote`` for 'Annotated bibliography':

In the ``annote`` field type, the user can store an annotation - a short, descriptive, and also an evaluative summary of the content of the reference the user wants to cite, typically displayed in the bibliography.

``annote`` is then of interest to the reader to determine the sources' quality, relevance, and accuracy in question.

## Example  

```tex
@article{Mueller2014The,

  ...

  annote={The authors offer a detailed overview of the...  }

  ...

}
```

## Reference types

All ``Entry types`` can process ``annote``. This attribute is considered atypical and is deemed to be optional in all cases.
