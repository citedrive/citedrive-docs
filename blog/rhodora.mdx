## How do I cite in  Rhodora?

Let us produce some example in-text-citations:

:::note Citations


This sentence refers to the first item from the table. (Doe 2008) This, in turn, refers to the second (Doe and Doe n.d.)
and then to the third.  (Doe et al. n.d.)
This paragraph demonstrates the clustering of citations by citing the first and third item. (Doe 2008, Doe et al. n.d.)

## How do I create a bibliography in Rhodora?

This bibliography contains all items from the sample table. Please note that these examples in the table consist only of articles. Other source types may require different handling, such as web pages that expect an access date, or movies, music tracks etc.

While we would like to show a few such concrete examples in the future - this series of articles is in fact in progress - we would like to point out that CiteDrive already features them.

:::note Bibliography
