# About Overleaf

Overleaf is a collaborative cloud-based editor used to write and edit  LaTeX-documents. It can also be described as the "Google Docs" for LaTeX users.
We at CiteDrive, another collaborative and cloud-based reference manager with native BibTeX support, directly connect to Overleaf. Literature and citations from CiteDrive can be conveniently generated so that both applications work effectively together. Find out more on how both work wonderfully together.
