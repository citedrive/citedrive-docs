## How do I create a bibliography in Einaudi (Italian)?

This bibliography contains all items from the sample table. Please note that these examples in the table consist only of articles. Other source types may require different handling, such as web pages that expect an access date, or movies, music tracks etc.

While we would like to show a few such concrete examples in the future - this series of articles is in fact in progress - we would like to point out that CiteDrive already features them.
